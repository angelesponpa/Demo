        President Joe Biden awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, 
        the nation's highest civilian honor, to Pope Francis on Saturday. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Biden bestowed the award on the pope during a phone call, 
        after originally being scheduled to be presented to the pope in person in Rome during Biden's final overseas trip.
